- As an administrator you should be able to see all distribution centres available to you, admin page can be augmented for this - 5% # Done - Jason #
- <del>Distribution Centre Manager should be a separate Spring Boot Project as a REST API protected by basic web security(username/password) - 5% # Deleted by the teacher # </del>
- Distribution centre app should have following models:distribution centre (id, name, items available, latitude,longitude), Item (same as in clothes warehouse). Important:we should add quantity to the item model - 3% # Done - Melody #

- Database interaction for all the above methods should besupported (included in 7% above) # Done - Melody #

- Create a form on the admin distribution centre page to requestitem by brand and name, logic should be the following(4%): # Doing - Mohammed #
- Form contains two fields: name and brand dropdown and submitbutton # Doing - Mohammed #
- On form submission we should check which distribution centrecontains items for these parameters
- Between centres with available items items should be requestedfrom the closest centre to the warehouse (warehouse shouldhave GTA area coordinates, exact location is up to you), youshould have at least 4 distribution centres and be able toclearly show me that logic works # Doing - Mohammed #
- If successful, stock should be replenished in warehouse anddeducted from distribution centre from which we get theitem, else we are redirected to the error page that containsmessage that stock canâ€™t be replenished- Add bootstrap styling to all components (1%)
