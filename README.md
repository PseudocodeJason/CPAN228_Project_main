Add support to request items for Clothes WarehouseProject in the distribution centres
- As an administrator you should be able to see all distribution centres available to you, admin page can be augmented for this - 5%
- Distribution Centre Manager should be a separate Spring Boot Project as a REST API protected by basic web security(username/password) - 5%
- Distribution centre app should have following models:distribution centre (id, name, items available, latitude,longitude), Item (same as in clothes warehouse). Important:we should add quantity to the item model - 3%
- Distribution centre should expose following endpoints: add itemto distribution centre, delete item, list all distributioncentres, request item by brand and name - 7% # Done - Melody #
- Database interaction for all the above methods should besupported (included in 7% above)
- Create two Spring profiles for distribution centre with differentdata sources: H2 for dev and PostgreSQL for QA, pleaseuse Docker for Postgres DB and make sure that alloperations work correctly - 5%
- Create a form on the admin distribution centre page to requestitem by brand and name, logic should be the following(4%):
- Form contains two fields: name and brand dropdown and submitbutton
- On form submission we should check which distribution centrecontains items for these parameters
- Between centres with available items items should be requestedfrom the closest centre to the warehouse (warehouse shouldhave GTA area coordinates, exact location is up to you), youshould have at least 4 distribution centres and be able toclearly show me that logic works
- If successful, stock should be replenished in warehouse anddeducted from distribution centre from which we get theitem, else we are redirected to the error page that containsmessage that stock canâ€™t be replenished- Add bootstrap styling to all components (1%)
